# Economics Honors Thesis

This repository contains code used as part of my senior thesis investigating the role of political fragmentation on urban spatial agglomeration. thesis_draf.pdf contains a rough draft of the first sections of the paper. Folders are arranged into "01-streams", containing the code for the "small streams" instrument. "02-incorporation-date" contains code for a potential secondary instrument utilizing the date of incorporation, though this is still under development. "03-agglomeration" contains code developing the primary measure of agglomeration used in the paper.
